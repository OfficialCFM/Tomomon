## Building
### Windows

To build on Windows, I suggest using Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 or above.  
You'll need to build FreeType (or find a pre-built binary online), but that should be all.  

### GNU/Linux

Any recent version of GCC should do. You'll have to find the appropriate FreeType 2.7 package for your distribution yourself. On Ubuntu 16.04+, you'll have to add a PPA: `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:no1wantdthisname/ppa` and then install it with `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libfreetype6`. That is all.
